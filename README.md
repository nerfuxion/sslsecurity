Vulnerable SSL webserver and database system - For expermentation and learning

The System consists of two components and one example attack:

**webserver** - A very small and minimalist web server that serves up pages from the **www** folder. It also communicates with the database

**database** - An even smaller database server that responds to requests from the webserver and serves up information that are stored in the **secrets** folder

**attack** - Two example attacks:
1 - a multi stage attack on the system. It attempts to read the database credentials from the webserver file system, and then uses the credentials to request information from the database directly, bypassing the webserver.
2 - a single stage attack that attempts to get the certificate off the webserver

This project is practically identical to the websecurity project, but the webserver uses ssl and there is an additional attack included
